## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/22MH1A4242/customer-segmentation-streamlit.git
cd customer-segmentation-streamlit

2. Install Requirements

📁 Sample Dataset
You can use the included Mall_Customers.csv or upload your own with similar structure:

CustomerID	Gender	Age	Annual Income (k$)	Spending Score (1–100)
1	Male	19	15	39
2	Male	21	15	81
...	...	...	...	...

💡 Business Insights (Generated by App)
Customers with high income but low spending might need better engagement or discounts.

Young customers with high spending scores could represent trend-driven buyers.

Outliers in any cluster may represent high-value or risky segments.
